**Group Instructor** - Janusz Rafałko

**Team 17-PL-12** - Maciej Grzeszczak, Henryk Kaczmarski, Sebastian Konowrocki _(leader)_, Kajetan Kotas, Stanisław Wasilkowski.

## Software Technology
The Project Game will be implemented using **.NET 4.6.2** framework and written in **C#** programming language. The main reason for that choice is that every member of the team is familiar with these to at least satisfactory extent. Besides that there is a wide range of avaliable programming libraries and mature community around that platform.

## Methodology
Methodology used to manage product development will be **Scrum**. It is one of the most popular software development framework nowadays and learning that may be beneficial for team members as they acquire necessary experience.

Roles according to Scrum methodology:

- _Scrum Master_ - **Sebastian Konowrocki**
- _Product Owner_ - **Stanisław Wasilkowski**
- _Developers Team_ - **Maciej Grzeszczak**, **Henryk Kaczmarski**, **Sebastian Konowrocki**, **Kajetan Kotas**, **Stanisław Wasilkowski**

In order to help and improve our cooperation we use **[Slack](https://io2team.slack.com)** as our communication platform, where we will consult our problems and then solve them efficiently and quickly. 
Tasks will be organized with the help of **[Trello](https://trello.com)** service, where everyone can get instant information about what is left to do and who is working on which task currently. This will also be the place where user stories, product backlog and summaries of the Scrum sprints will be kept, so everyone can access it at any time.
Changes in code will be tracked with Git version control system. Elected branching model and commit naming convention is inspired by **[Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)** which will be enforced **strictly**.
